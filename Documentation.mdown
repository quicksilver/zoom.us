# zoom.us Plugin #

## Overview ##

This plug-in streamlines the process of joining Zoom meetings.

## Actions ##

Join Meeting
  : This action works on Zoom Meeting objects selected in the first pane. Currently, the only such object is the **Next Zoom Meeting** proxy object described below.

Join Zoom Meeting
  : Running this action on an HTTP URL will extract the meeting ID and open it using Zoom’s `zoommtg://` URL scheme, which bypasses your browser and opens directly in Zoom.

## Proxy Objects ##

### Next Zoom Meeting ###

This proxy represents any Zoom Meeting[^1] occurring in the next 10 minutes. Simply select it and hit Return to join. You can also share it with others using Paste, E-mail To…, and other actions.

The number of minutes can be adjusted using a hidden preference. For example, to change it to 30 minutes:

    defaults write com.blacktree.Quicksilver ZoomCheckForwardMinutes 30

[^1]: The plug-in will look for a Zoom URL in the Location, URL, and Notes for all upcoming events. The first match it finds will be used.
